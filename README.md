# LeagueLoader

**LeagueLoader** is a command line application designed to take a
list of summoner IDs from your database and then download their
KDA and CS.

## Installation From Release

* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/NetaGaming/LeagueLoader/releases/tag/v1.5)
  * You will need the *config.json.template*, *LeagueLoader*, and *tables.sql*
	  files
* Navigate to the folder where you saved these files
* Run the *tables.sql* file into MySQL

	```
	mysql -u yourusername -p yourpassword yourdatabase < tables.sql
	# or if you're already in MySQL
	source tables.sql
	```
* Update create a *config.json* file and update it to include your database
  credentials, Riot API key, and your rate limits

## Usage

After setting up your configuration and importing the database tables, all you
need to do is run **LeagueLoader**:

```sh
./LeagueLoader
```

Keep in mind that **LeagueLoader** looks for the configuration file in the
directory where you called the application. For example, a cronjob will
require `cd`'ing to the folder with the configuration file first.

```sh
*/60 * * * * cd /opt/leagueloader 1> /dev/null 2>> /tmp/leagueloader.err && ./leagueloader 1> /dev/null 2>> /tmp/ll.err
```
